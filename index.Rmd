### VAR models (4th topic of Macroenometrics (44343))

<br>


Hi students! Wellcome to the course website!!

<br>

This is the website for the 4th topic of the 2019-2020 Macroeconometrics course (Master in Economics) at the University of Valencia. Mariam has delivered already the first 3 topics and I’m in charge of the last and 4th: **VAR models**. The repo to build this web is hosted on Gitbub: <https://github.com/perezp44/VAR-models-web/>{target="_blank"}.

**Topic summary:** The topic is an introduction to structural VAR models, one of the principal research toolkit in macroeconomic research.

As you know the classes were face-to-face but then the covid-19 ... I hope all this will pass soon!! We will try our best lo learn as much as possible about VAR models!!
