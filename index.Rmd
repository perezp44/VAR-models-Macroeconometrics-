### VAR models (4th topic of Macroenometrics (44343))

<br><br>


Hi students! 


This is the website for the 4th topic of the 2019-2020 Macroeconometrics course from the Master in Economics at the University of Valencia. Mariam has delivered already the first 3 topics and I’m in charge of the last and 4th: **VAR models**. The repo of this web is hosted in Gitbub, [here](https://github.com/perezp44/VAR-models-web/).

As you know the classes were face-to-face but then the covid-19 ... I hope all this will pass soon!! We will try our best lo learn something about VAR models!!

**Wellcome to the course website!!**

-- Pedro J. Pérez

**Topic summary:** The topic is an introduction to structural VAR models, one of the principal research toolkit in macroeconomic research.
