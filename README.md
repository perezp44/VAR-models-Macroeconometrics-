This is the repo that builds the website for the 4th topic of the 2019-2020 Macroeconometrics
course (44343, Master in Economics at the University of Valencia).

The website is here: <https://perezp44.github.io/VAR-models-web/index.html>{target="_blank"}

Hi students\!

Mariam has delivered already the first 3 topics and I’m in charge of the
last and 4th: **VAR models**.

As you know the classes were face-to-face but then the covid-19 … I hope
all this will pass soon. 

We will try our best lo learn as much as possible about
VAR models\!\!
