## Schedulle

------------------------------

VAR models, the 4th topic of Macroeconometrics, was planned to be delibered in 5 classes: 16th, 20th, 23th, 27th and 30th of April, from 8:30 to 10:30 (spanish time, UTC + 2 hours)

I think it is better to keep the official schedule, then, if nothing happens, we are going to have 5 on-line meetings using Black Board Collaborate. You can access the meetings throught [Aula Virtual](https://aulavirtual.uv.es/course/view.php?id=9759).

"The plan" is to meet you 5 times:
