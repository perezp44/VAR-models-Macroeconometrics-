## Schedule

------------------------------

VAR models, the 4th topic of Macroeconometrics, was planned to be delibered in 5 classes: 16th, 20th, 23th, 27th and 30th of April, from 8:30 to 10:30 (spanish time, UTC + 2 hours)

I think it is better to keep the official schedule, then, if nothing happens, we are going to have 5 on-line meetings using Black Board Collaborate. You can access the meetings throught [Aula Virtual](https://aulavirtual.uv.es/course/view.php?id=9759).

------------------------------

<br>

"The plan" is to meet you 5 times:

-----------------------

<br>

### 1st session

- **`Date/time`:** Thursday 16th of April at **9:00** (time of Spain, UTC+2 hours).  

- The first class should be devoted to:  

  - talk about how the course will works.  

  - explain how to deliver the VAR assignment.  

  - explain a litle bite of R, Rprojects & Rmarkdown (because you will have to deliver your assignment using Rmarkdown).  

  - Start to learn about VAR models & methodology: Introduction to VAR models.  

<br>

- **`Homework`**: before the e-meeting, at least, you should,  

    - read the [`Course "plan"`](https://perezp44.github.io/VAR-models-web/01-Course-plan.html) section of the website.  
    
    - read the sections 1, 2.1 & 2.2 of the [Slides](https://perezp44.github.io/VAR-models-web/03-Slides.html)
    
    - read section 3 of [this tutorial](https://perezp44.github.io/VAR-models-web/tt_01_primeros-pasos-con-R.html). If you have problems because it is written in Spanish, you could read something similar [here](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html){target="_blank"}.

<br>

- After the e-meeting you should know:

   - What is exactly a **VAR model**?
   
   - Why VAR are used in Macroeconomics?
    
   - When the VAR's were started to be used in Macroeconomics?

   - To write down the equation(s) of a VAR model. 
   
   - What is it and what are the benefits of using **Rprojects**.
   
   - What is and what is the utility of **Rmarkdown**.
  

<br>

Too much  for the first class? I don't think so, but we will see ...

<br>

**Challenge:** If you fully understand the following sentence you should deserve to pass the course already.

> Sims's original idea to obtain IRF&FEVD was to assume recursive contemporaneous interactions among variables, i.e. by imposing a certain structural ordering of the variables. In terms of the moving average (MA) representation, the structural shocks do not affect preceding variables simultaneously (Cholesky)
